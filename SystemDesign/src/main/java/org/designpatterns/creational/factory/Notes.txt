Type: Creational

UseCase Implementation Example: Course Website which provides various courses and subsequent modules

Analogy: Factory producing different types of bottle lids, the implementation is hidden but the client gets the lids as per requirement

Real-world Example :
    -Architects create design and interfaces for the team
    -Calendar and NumberFormat in Java
    -Frameworks and Library


--Creating objects of similar type
--Hides complexity of object creation
--Client code has no idea about object creation

We would need to use
    1.Factory Class(Abstract Interface) --> Exposed to the Client Code
        -Factory Method
    2.Concrete Class(Real Implementation)
        -Factory Method Implementation

Pros
-Simple concept
-Gurantees Abstraction
-Code is flexible and adaptable
-Very useful for frameworks and libraries

Cons
-Refactoring of existing code into this pattern is quite complex - Not a pattern that can be refactored into
Complex code
Takes time to set the base

Summary
-Useful for creation of objects that fall under same categorization but still have different properties
-Helps in hiding complexity
-One has to start thinking ahead to implement such a pattern
